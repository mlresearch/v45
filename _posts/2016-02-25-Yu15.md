title: Maximum Margin Partial Label Learning
abstract: 'Partial label learning deals with the problem that each training example
  is associated with a set of \emphcandidate labels, and only one among the set is
  the ground-truth label. The basic strategy to learn from partial label examples
  is disambiguation, i.e. by trying to recover the ground-truth labeling information
  from the candidate label set. As one of the major machine learning techniques, maximum
  margin criterion has been employed to solve the partial label learning problem.
  Therein, disambiguation is performed by optimizing the margin between the maximum
  modeling output from candidate labels and that from non-candidate labels. However,
  in this formulation the margin between the ground-truth label and other candidate
  labels is not differentiated. In this paper, a new maximum margin formulation for
  partial label learning is proposed which aims to directly maximize the margin between
  the ground-truth label and all other labels. Specifically, an alternating optimization
  procedure is utilized to coordinate \emphground-truth label identification and \emphmargin
  maximization. Extensive experiments show that the derived partial label learning
  approach achieves competitive performance against other state-of-the-art comparing
  approaches. '
