title: Consistency of structured output learning with missing labels
abstract: In this paper we study statistical consistency of partial losses suitable
  for learning structured output predictors from examples containing missing labels.
  We provide sufficient conditions on data generating distribution which admit to
  prove that the expected risk of the structured predictor learned by minimizing the
  partial loss converges to the optimal Bayes risk defined by an associated complete
  loss. We define a concept of surrogate classification calibrated partial losses
  which are easier to optimize yet their minimization preserves the statistical consistency.
  We give some concrete examples of surrogate partial losses which are classification
  calibrated. In particular, we show that the ramp-loss which is in the core of many
  existing algorithms  is classification calibrated.
