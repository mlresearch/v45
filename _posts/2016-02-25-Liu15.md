title: Preference Relation-based Markov Random Fields for Recommender Systems
abstract: A \emphpreference relation-based Top-N recommendation approach,  \emphPrefMRF,
  is proposed to capture both the second-order and  the higher-order interactions
  among users and items.  Traditionally Top-N recommendation was achieved by predicting  the
  item ratings first, and then inferring the item rankings,  based on the assumption
  of availability of \emphexplicit feedbacks  such as ratings, and the assumption
  that optimizing the ratings  is equivalent to optimizing the item rankings.  Nevertheless,
  both assumptions are not always true in real  world applications. The proposed \emphPrefMRF
  approach drops these  assumptions by explicitly exploiting the preference relations,  a
  more practical user feedback.  Comparing to related work, the proposed \emphPrefMRF
  approach has  the unique property of modeling both the second-order and the  higher-order
  interactions among users and items. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
  time both types of interactions have been captured in \emphpreference relation-based
  method. Experiment results on public datasets demonstrate that both  types of interactions
  have been properly captured,  and significantly improved Top-N recommendation performance  has
  been achieved.
