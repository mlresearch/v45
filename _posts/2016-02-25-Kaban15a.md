title: Non-asymptotic Analysis of Compressive Fisher Discriminants in terms of the
  Effective Dimension
abstract: We provide a non-asymptotic analysis of the generalisation error of compressive
  Fisher linear discriminant (FLD) classification that is dimension free under mild
  assumptions. Our analysis includes the effects that random projection has on classification
  performance under covariance model misspecification,  as well as various good and
  bad effects of random projections that contribute to the overall performance of
  compressive FLD. We also give an asymptotic bound as a corollary of our finite sample
  result. An important ingredient of our analysis is to develop new dimension-free
  bounds on the largest and smallest eigenvalue of the compressive covariance,  which
  may be of independent interest.
