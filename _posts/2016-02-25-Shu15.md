title: Integration of Single-view Graphs with Diffusion of Tensor Product Graphs for
  Multi-view Spectral Clustering
abstract: Multi-view clustering takes diversity of multiple views (representations)
  into consideration. Multiple views may be obtained from various sources or different
  feature subsets and often provide complementary information to each other. In this
  paper, we propose a novel graph-based approach to integrate multiple representations
  to improve clustering performance. While original graphs have been widely used in
  many existing multi-view clustering approaches, the key idea of our approach is
  to integrate multiple views by exploring higher order information. In particular,
  given graphs constructed separately from single view data, we build cross-view tensor
  product graphs (TPGs), each of which is a Kronecker product of a pair of single-view
  graphs. Since each cross-view TPG captures higher order relationships of data under
  two different views, it is no surprise that we obtain more reliable similarities.  We
  linearly combine multiple cross-view TPGs to integrate higher order information.
  Efficient graph diffusion process on the fusion TPG helps to reveal the underlying
  cluster structure and boosts the clustering performance. Empirical study shows that
  the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.
