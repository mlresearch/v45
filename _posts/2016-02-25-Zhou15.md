title: Largest Source Subset Selection for Instance Transfer
abstract: 'Instance-transfer learning has emerged as a promising  learning framework
  to boost performance of prediction models on newly-arrived tasks. The success of
  the framework depends on the relevance of the source data to the target data. This
  paper proposes a new approach to source data selection for instance-transfer learning.  The
  approach is capable of selecting the largest subset S^* of the source data which
  relevance to the target data is statistically guaranteed to be the highest among
  any superset of S^*. The approach is formally described and theoretically justified.  Experimental
  results on real-world data sets demonstrate that the approach outperforms existing
  instance selection methods. '
