title: 'Bayesian Masking: Sparse Bayesian Estimation with Weaker Shrinkage Bias'
abstract: 'A common strategy for sparse linear regression is to introduce regularization,
  which eliminates irrelevant features by letting the corresponding weights be zeros.
  However, regularization often shrinks the estimator for relevant features, which
  leads to incorrect feature selection. Motivated by the above-mentioned issue, we
  propose Bayesian masking (BM), a sparse estimation method which imposes no regularization
  on the weights.  The key concept of BM is to introduce binary latent variables that
  randomly mask features. Estimating the masking rates determines the relevance of
  the features automatically. We derive a variational Bayesian inference algorithm
  that maximizes the lower bound of the factorized information criterion (FIC), which
  is a recently developed asymptotic criterion for evaluating the marginal log-likelihood.
  In addition, we propose reparametrization to accelerate the convergence of the derived
  algorithm. Finally, we show that BM outperforms Lasso and automatic relevance determination
  (ARD) in terms of the sparsity-shrinkage trade-off. '
