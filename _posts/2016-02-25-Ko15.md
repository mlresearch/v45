title: Expectation Propagation for Rectified Linear Poisson Regression
abstract: The Poisson likelihood with rectified linear function as non-linearity is
  a physically plausible model to discribe the stochastic arrival process of photons
  or other particles at a detector.  At low emission rates the discrete nature of
  this process leads to measurement noise that behaves very differently from additive
  white Gaussian noise. To address the intractable inference problem for such models,
  we present a novel efficient and robust Expectation Propagation algorithm entirely
  based on analytically tractable computations operating reliably in regimes where
  quadrature based implementations can fail. Full posterior inference therefore becomes
  an attractive alternative in areas generally dominated by methods of point estimation.
  Moreover, we discuss the rectified linear function in the context of other common
  non-linearities and identify situations where it can serve as a robust alternative.
