title: Sufficient Dimension Reduction via Direct Estimation of the Gradients of Logarithmic
  Conditional Densities
abstract: Sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) is a framework of supervised linear
  dimension reduction, and is aimed at finding a low-dimensional orthogonal projection
  matrix for input data such that the projected input data retains maximal information
  on output data. A computationally efficient approach employs gradient estimates
  of the conditional density of the output given input data to find an appropriate
  projection matrix. However, since the gradients of the conditional densities are
  typically estimated by a local linear smoother, it does not perform well when the
  input dimensionality is high. In this paper, we propose a novel estimator of the
  gradients of logarithmic conditional densities called the \emphleast-squares logarithmic
  conditional density gradients (LSLCG), which fits a gradient model \emphdirectly
  to the true gradient without conditional density estimation under the squared loss.
  Thanks to the simple least-squares formulation, LSLCG gives a closed-form solution
  that can be computed efficiently. In addition, all the parameters can be automatically
  determined by cross-validation. Through experiments on a large variety of artificial
  and benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the SDR method based on LSLCG outperforms
  existing SDR methods both in estimation accuracy and computational efficiency.
