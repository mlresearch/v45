title: Class-prior Estimation for Learning from Positive and Unlabeled Data
abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the \emphclass prior in an unlabeled
  dataset. Under the assumption that an additional labeled dataset is available, the
  class prior can be estimated by fitting a mixture of class-wise data distributions
  to the unlabeled data distribution. However, in practice, such an additional labeled
  dataset is often not available. In this paper, we show that, with additional samples
  coming only from the positive class, the class prior of the unlabeled dataset can
  be estimated correctly. Our key idea is to use properly penalized divergences for
  model fitting to cancel the error caused by the absence of negative samples. We
  further show that the use of the penalized L_1-distance gives a computationally
  efficient algorithm with an analytic solution, and establish its uniform deviation
  bound and estimation error bound. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the usefulness
  of the proposed method.
