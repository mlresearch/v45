title: Streaming Variational Inference for Dirichlet Process Mixtures
abstract: Bayesian nonparametric models are theoretically suitable to learn streaming
  data due to their complexity relaxation to the volume of observed data. However,
  most of the existing variational inference algorithms are not applicable to streaming
  applications since they require truncation on variational distributions. In this
  paper, we present two truncation-free variational algorithms, one for mix-membership
  inference called TFVB (truncation-free variational Bayes), and the other for hard
  clustering inference called TFME (truncation-free maximization expectation). With
  these algorithms, we further developed a streaming learning framework for the popular
  Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) models. Our experiments demonstrate the usefulness
  of our framework in both synthetic and real-world data.
