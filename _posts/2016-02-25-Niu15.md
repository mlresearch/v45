title: A Unified Framework for Jointly Learning Distributed Representations of Word
  and Attributes
abstract: 'Distributed word representations have achieved great success in natural
  language processing (NLP) area. However, most distributed models focus on local
  context properties and learn task-specific representations individually, therefore
  lack the ability to fuse multi-attributes and learn jointly. In this paper, we propose
  a unified framework which jointly learns distributed representations of word and
  attributes: characteristics of word. In our models, we consider three types of attributes:
  topic, lemma and document. Besides learning distributed attribute representations,
  we find that using additional attributes is beneficial to improve word representations.
  Several experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the learned topic
  representations, document representations, and improved word representations, respectively.
  The experimental results show that our models achieve significant and competitive
  results. '
