title: 'Detecting Accounting Frauds in Publicly Traded U.S. Firms: A Machine Learning
  Approach'
abstract: This paper studies how machine learning techniques can facilitate the detection
  of accounting fraud in publicly traded US firms. Existing studies often mimic human
  experts and employ the financial or nonfinancial ratios as the features for their
  systems. We depart from these studies by adopting raw accounting variables, which
  are directly available from a firmâ€™s financial statement and thereby can be easily
  applied to new firms at low cost. Further, we collected the most complete fraud
  dataset of US publicly traded firms and labeled the fraud and non-fraud firm-years.
  One key issue of the dataset is that the data is extremely imbalanced, in which
  the fraud firm-years are often less than one percent. Without re-sampling the data,
  we further propose to tackle the imbalance issue by adopting the techniques of imbalanced
  learning. In particular, we employ the linear and nonlinear Biased Penalty Support
  Vector Machine and the Ensemble Methods, both of which have been proved to successfully
  handle the imbalance issue in the machine learning literatures. We finally evaluate
  our approach by conducting extensive empirical studies. Empirical results show that
  the proposed schema can achieve much better performance, in terms of balanced accuracy,
  than the state of the art. Besides the performance, our approaches can also compute
  very fast, which further supports their practical deployment.
