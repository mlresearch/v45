title: Continuous Target Shift Adaptation in Supervised Learning
abstract: Supervised learning in machine learning concerns inferring an underlying
  relation between covariate \bx and target y based on training covariate-target data.
  It is traditionally assumed that training data and test data, on which the generalization
  performance of a learning algorithm is measured, follow the same probability distribution.
  However, this standard assumption is often violated in many real-world applications
  such as computer vision, natural language processing, robot control, or survey design,
  due to intrinsic non-stationarity of the environment or inevitable sample selection
  bias. This situation is called \emphdataset shift and has attracted a great deal
  of attention recently. In the paper, we consider supervised learning problems under
  the \emphtarget shift scenario, where the target marginal distribution p(y) changes
  between the training and testing phases, while the target-conditioned covariate
  distribution p(\bx|y) remains unchanged. Although various methods for mitigating
  target shift in classification (a.k.a. \emphclass prior change) have been developed
  so far, few methods can be applied to continuous targets. In this paper, we propose
  methods for continuous target shift adaptation in regression and conditional density
  estimation. More specifically, our contribution is a novel importance weight estimator
  for continuous targets. Through experiments, the usefulness of the proposed method
  is demonstrated.
