title: Surrogate regret bounds for generalized classification performance metrics
abstract: We consider optimization of generalized performance metrics for binary classification
  by means of surrogate loss.  We focus on a class of metrics, which are linear-fractional
  functions of the false positive and false negative rates (examples of which include
  F_β-measure, Jaccard similarity coefficient, AM measure, and many others). Our analysis
  concerns the following two-step procedure. First, a real-valued function f is learned
  by minimizing a surrogate loss for binary classification on the training sample.
  It is assumed that the surrogate loss is a strongly proper composite loss function
  (examples of which include logistic loss, squared-error loss, exponential loss,
  etc.). Then, given f, a threshold \hatθ is tuned on a separate validation sample,
  by direct optimization of the target performance measure. We show that the regret
  of the resulting classifier (obtained from thresholding f on \hatθ)  measured with
  respect to the target metric is upperbounded by the regret of f measured with respect
  to the surrogate loss.  Our finding is further analyzed in a computational study
  on both synthetic and real data sets.
