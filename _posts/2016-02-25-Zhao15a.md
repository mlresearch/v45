title: Curriculum Learning of Bayesian Network Structures
abstract: "Bayesian networks (BNs) are directed graphical models that have been widely
  used in various tasks for probabilistic reasoning and causal modeling.  One major
  challenge in these tasks is to learn the BN structures from data. In this paper,
  we propose a novel heuristic algorithm for BN structure learning that takes advantage
  of the idea of \\emphcurriculum learning. Our algorithm learns the BN structure
  by stages. At each stage a subnet is learned over a selected subset of the random
  variables conditioned on fixed values of the rest of the variables. The selected
  subset grows with stages and eventually includes all the variables. We prove theoretical
  advantages of our algorithm and also empirically show that it outperformed the state-of-the-art
  heuristic approach in learning BN structures.\t "
