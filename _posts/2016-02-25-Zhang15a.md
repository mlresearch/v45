title: Robust Multivariate Regression with Grossly Corrupted Observations and Its
  Application to Personality Prediction
abstract: 'We consider the problem of multivariate linear regression with a small
  fraction of the responses being missing and grossly corrupted, where the magnitudes
  and locations of such occurrences are not known in priori. This is addressed in
  our approach by explicitly taking into account the error source and its sparseness
  nature. Moreover, our approach allows each regression task to possess its distinct
  noise level. We also propose a new algorithm that is theoretically shown to always
  converge to the optimal solution of its induced non-smooth optimization problem.
  Experiments on controlled simulations suggest the competitiveness of our algorithm
  comparing to existing multivariate regression models. In particular, we apply our
  model to predict the \textitBig-Five personality from user behaviors at Social Network
  Sites (SNSs) and microblogs, an important yet difficult problem in psychology, where
  empirical results demonstrate its superior performance with respect to related learning
  methods. '
