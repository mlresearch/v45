title: "Proximal Average Approximated Incremental Gradient Method for Composite Penalty
  Regularized Empirical Risk Minimization\x03"
abstract: 'Proximal average (PA) is an approximation technique proposed recently to
  handle nonsmooth composite regularizer in empirical risk minimization problem. For
  nonsmooth composite regularizer, it is often difficult to directly derive the corresponding
  proximal update when solving with popular proximal update. While traditional approaches
  resort to complex splitting methods like ADMM, proximal average provides an alternative,
  featuring the tractability of implementation and theoretical analysis. Nevertheless,
  compared to SDCA-ADMM and SAG-ADMM which are examples of ADMM-based methods achieving
  faster convergence rate and low per-iteration complexity, existing PA-based approaches
  either converge slowly (e.g. PA-ASGD) or suffer from high per-iteration cost (e.g.
  PA-APG). In this paper, we therefore propose a new PA-based algorithm called PA-SAGA,
  which is optimal in both convergence rate and per-iteration cost, by incorporating
  into incremental gradient-based framework. '
