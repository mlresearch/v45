title: Autoencoder Trees
abstract: 'We discuss an autoencoder model in which the encoding and decoding functions
  are implemented by decision trees. We use the soft decision tree where internal
  nodes realize soft multivariate splits given by a gating function and the overall
  output is the average of all leaves weighted by the gating values on their path.
  The encoder tree takes the input and generates a lower dimensional representation
  in the leaves and the decoder tree takes this and reconstructs the original input.
  Exploiting the continuity of the trees, autoencoder trees are trained with stochastic
  gradient-descent. On handwritten digit and news data, we see that the autoencoder
  trees yield good reconstruction error compared to traditional autoencoder perceptrons.
  We also see that the autoencoder tree captures hierarchical representations at different
  granularities of the data on its different levels and the leaves capture the localities
  in the input space. '
