title: Statistical Unfolded Logic Learning
abstract: During the past decade, Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) and Probabilistic
  Inductive Logic Programming (PILP), owing to their strength in capturing structure
  information, have attracted much attention for learning relational models such as
  weighted logic rules. Typically, a generative model is assumed for the structured
  joint distribution, and the learning process is accomplished in an enormous relational
  space. In this paper, we propose a new framework, i.e., Statistical Unfolded Logic
  (SUL) learning. In contrast to learning rules in the relational space directly,
  SUL propositionalizes the structure information into an attribute-value data set,
  and thus, statistical discriminative learning which is much more efficient than
  generative relational learning can be executed. In addition to achieving better
  generalization performance, SUL is able to conduct predicate invention that is hard
  to be realized by traditional SRL and PILP approaches. Experiments on real tasks
  show that our proposed approach is superior to state-of-the-art weighted rules learning
  approaches.
